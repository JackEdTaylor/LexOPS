\title{Generate a citation}
\usage{
cite_design(df, include = "design")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Output from \code{generate()} or \code{long_format()}}

\item{include}{A string indicating which variables to include in the citation. This can be those specified by \code{split_by()} and \code{control_for()} (\code{"design"}), only those specified in \code{split_by()} (\code{"splits"}), or only those specified by \code{control_for()} (\code{"controls"}). Alternatively, this can be a character vector of the variables that should be cited, that were in the original dataframe. Default is \code{"design"}.}
}
\value{
A tibble that lists measures and sources of data that should be cited (if known).
}
\description{
Takes the output from \code{generate()} or \code{long_format()}, and generates a tibble that lists known references that should be cited.
