LexOPS is an R package and Shiny App for generating word stimuli, for
use in Psychology experiments. It can generate stimuli for a factorial
design specified by the user, controlling for selected lexical
variables. It also has several features for visualising variables’
distributions and relationships. The app has an inbuilt database of
features for English words, but the user can also provide their own list
of features, for English words and/or for words in other languages.

LexOPS can be installed as an R package with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("JackEdTaylor/LexOPS")
```
